## 3) Problem Statement

- Artificial skin experiments are essential in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and biotech.
- Current challenges:
  - **Delayed abnormal detection** → minor issues often missed
  - **High manual workload** → recording and reporting data is time-consuming
  - **Limited data utilization** → trends and patterns difficult to track

---

## 4) Business Overview

- **Objective:** Efficiently and accurately detect abnormal reactions in artificial skin experiments and provide instant alerts.
- **Core Idea:**
  - Focused on a **hybrid, two-step verification system**
  - **Image-based AI** → triggers **chemical-based AI automatic analysis** upon abnormal detection → alert sent + **visualized data provided**
- **Differentiation:** Uses standard artificial skin products + **AI-based abnormal detection, automated alerts, automation integration, and visualized reports**, maximizing experimental efficiency and safety.

## 5) Technical Composition

### Hybrid / Two-Step Verification System

**Step 1: Image-Based AI Analysis**

- Capture artificial skin surface → detect color changes and surface pattern abnormalities
- Minor abnormalities automatically trigger **Step 2 chemical analysis**

**Step 2: Chemical-Based AI Analysis**

- Measure pH, absorption, decomposition, and other precision metrics
- Confirm abnormalities based on Step 1 alerts
- **Minimize false positives**, improve detection accuracy

**Automation and Visualized Reports**

- Instant alerts to researchers upon abnormal detection
- Automatic updating of experimental records and report generation
- **Data visualization** → trends, abnormal intensity, and pattern charts
- Minimal researcher intervention → **highly reliable abnormal detection**
